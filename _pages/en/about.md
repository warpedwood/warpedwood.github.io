My research focuses on the right to self-determination in Bolivia and Chile and
its transformation from a right to the State to a right to autonomy since the
1970s, thanks to its claim by the Non-Aligned Movement and its appropriation by
indigenous peoples. For more details, see [research](/projects/).

I earned my [Ph.D](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04124332) in political science, major international relations, from Sciences Po, under the supervision of Prof. Thierry Balzacq.
